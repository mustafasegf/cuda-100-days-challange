# Day 12

File: [convolution.cu](https://github.com/mustafasegf/cuda-100-days-challange/blob/master/day-012/convolution.cu)

implemented convolution in 4 different way

what i do
- read pmpp book chapter 7
- implemented convolution kernel
- implemented convolution with const memory
- implemented convolution with shared memory
- implemented convolution with shared memory + global kernel

## PMPP book chap 7
this chapter discus about how to do convolution kernel and different way to optimize it. it shows concretely how to optimize it steps by steps. talks more about how to make better data access pattern
